## References 
Throughout this project, you have likely used outside resources. Reference all ideas which are not your own, 
and describe how you integrated the ideas or code into your program. This includes online sources, people who have 
helped you, AI tools you've used, and any other resources that are not solely your own contribution. Update as you go.

'I asked Nicholas for help once and the solution worked fine for a while, but I ended up doing something else.'

## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

**Title**: `GUI of NIM`

**Purpose**: `It is, in essence, the Game of NIM but it now has a GUI that is not a textbox.`

**Source Assignment(s)**: `The Game of Nim.`

**CRC Card(s)**:
  - Create a CRC card for each class that your project will implement.
  - See this link for a sample CRC card and a template to use for your own cards (you will have to make a copy to edit):
    [CRC Card Example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JE_3Qmytk_JGztRqkPXWACJwciPH61VCx3idIlBCVFY/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Tables in markdown are not easy, so we suggest saving your CRC card as an image and including the image(s) in the 
    README. You can do this by saving an image in the repository and linking to it. See the sample CRC card below - 
    and REPLACE it with your own:

️**Branches**: This project will **require** effective use of git.

Each partner should create a branch at the beginning of the project, and stay on this branch (or branches of their 
branch) as they work. When you need to bring each others branches together, do so by merging each other's branches 
into your own, following the process we've discussed in previous assignments: 

```
    Branch 1 name: rylandc (deleted)
    Branch 2 name: rylandc2
```

## Milestone 2: Code Setup and Issue Queue

Most importantly, keep your issue queue up to date, and focus on your code.

Reflect on what you’ve done so far. How’s it going? Are you feeling behind/ahead? What are you worried about? 
What has surprised you so far? Describe your general feelings. Be honest with yourself; this section is for you, not me.

```
    I do feel behind (because I am), but I feel like I'm behind because I don't know how to solve an issue.
    I think once I figure out the connection piece, it'll be easier for me to keep up.
```

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-In

Indicate what percentage of the project you have left to complete and how confident you feel. 

️**Completion Percentage**: `90%`

️**Confidence**: Describe how confident you feel about completing this project, and why. Then, describe some 
  strategies you can employ to increase the likelihood that you'll be successful in completing this project 
  before the deadline.

```
    I am confident I can complete this project.
```

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

### User Instructions
First, the program will ask you if you need instructions. You do have to enter 'Y' or 'N'. Then, it will ask
if you want to set the number of bells yourself. The alternative is a generated number. Then, a GUI box will
pop up. It has a textbox entry, button, and number. The number is the number of bells. Enter how many bells you
will take into the textbox and press the button. The computer will take its turn, and the number will update.
Repeat until either you or the computer take the last bell. The one who does loses.

### Reflection
In three to four well-written paragraphs, address the following (at a minimum):
- Why did you select the project that you did?
- How closely did your final project reflect your initial design?
- What did you learn from this process?
- What was the hardest part of the final project?
- What would you do differently next time, knowing what you know now?

I will do this section on a separate document and upload a PDF to GitHub.
